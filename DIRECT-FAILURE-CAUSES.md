## Possible causes of a direct failure by the CRDAO

The following is a non-exhaustive list of possible causes of direct failure for the code reviews submitted to the CRDAO by DEVxDAO:

- Code repo unreachable
- Code repo is empty or partially uploaded
- Code repo has a significantly different project than what is expected based on the milestone
- License missing, unacceptable or not matching the grant
- README.md file is missing or empty
- Build or installation requirements are not documented
- Build, installation or usage instructions are completely missing
- Documentation is completely missing or extremely sparse
- Missing Tests

_Please note that this list may be updated in the future based on experience with the new code review submissions. Please also note that the reviewer may choose to give a direct failure recommendation for reasons which are not on this list, based on the specific case._
