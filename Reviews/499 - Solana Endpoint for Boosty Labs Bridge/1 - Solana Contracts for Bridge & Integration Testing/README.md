# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

Deliverables:
Clone the Ethereum Contract to Solana.
Integrate Boosty’s oracle/validator system.

We request half the value of this milestone in advance per #191, resolution relating to “MILESTONE PAYMENTS”.

**Acceptance criteria:**

Users can send bridge tokens through Boosty’s Ethereum and Casper contracts.  These contracts will be deployed to solana testnet and mainnet with the rest of the Boosty Bridge hits those phases but that is out of scope for this grant.

CRDAO will be evaluating the solana contracts and test suite for the contracts only.  Integration tests will be bundled with Boosty's original grant.
