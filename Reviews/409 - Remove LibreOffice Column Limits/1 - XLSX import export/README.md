Grant Proposal | [409 - Towards Decentralized Documents: Remove LibreOffice Column Limits](https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/409)
------------ | -------------
Milestone | 1
Milestone Title | XLSX import/export
OP | Muhammet Kara
Reviewer | Yusuf Keten

# Milestone Details
The review will cover the 1st milestone criteria set forth below.

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

Remove the 1024 columns limit in Calc and make it dynamic: up to the  XLSX import/export.

**Acceptance criteria:**

XLSX import/export feature will be verifiable by following the steps below:

1) Create a document in Excel that has more than 1024 columns.
2) Save it as XLSX.
3) Open it in Calc.
4) Notice that the file opens without truncating the content to 1024 columns.
5) Make some changes to the file, save it to XLSX.
6) Open the resulting XLSX in Excel and confirm that no columns are truncated.

**Additional notes regarding submission from OP:**

We have finished working on the XLSX filter, and once you opt in for this
new feature, it works reasonably well for the:

Remove the 1024 columns limit in Calc and make it dynamic: up to
the XLSX import/export.

milestone.

A demo document: https://github.com/mrkara/ColumnLimitSampleDocs/raw/master/orig.xlsx

(Loading this just crashes on libreoffice-7-3 and both XLSX import and export works on master, where our work has been merged.)

Here is how you can test this yourself:

1) Get a master daily build from https://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/master/current.html

2) Start LibreOffice, go to Tools -> Options -> LibreOffice -> Advanced,
enable Experimental features, and restart LibreOffice.

3) Go to Calc, then Tools -> Options -> Calc -> Defaults, enable "very
large spreadsheets".

Then close the empty Calc document and you can start testing.

Let us know if it helps to have a short screenshare session where we
show you this in action.

Opting in is necessary for now, as the "enable very large spreadsheet"
switch is a global one, and we plan to enable it during March, when ODS
support will be also ready.

Thank you!

# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

There is a guide about the build process of LibreOffice. However, all of the submission commits are merged into the project. Therefore, the reviewer installed the latest LibreOffice master build. (2022-Mar-15 14:29) The project is tested on macOS BigSur 11.4 and the installation file name was ["LibreOfficeDev_7.4.0.0.alpha0_MacOS_x86-64.dmg".](https://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/master/MacOSX-x86_64@tb81-TDF/2022-03-15_15.39.42/LibreOfficeDev_7.4.0.0.alpha0_MacOS_x86-64.dmg)

Build Guideline: https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/source-code/

Daily master builds: https://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/master/

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The commits are all merged into the project. LibreOffice has a strict CI/CD process. Also, the reviewer installed the latest LibreOffice master build successfully. The reviewer has observed that it can open any document that has more than 1024 columns. Lastly, the reviewer has observed that the document can be saved and opened in Excel without any truncation.

Requirement | Finding

Project functionality meets/exceeds acceptance criteria and operates without error | PASS

# Unit / Automated Testing

LibreOffice has two types of automatic checks:
* unit tests check low level functionality at compile time
* subsequenttests check high level functionality

The build output includes the unit tests that run at compile time. After the last commit is pushed to the repository, the CI tool has started a build with tests. The build has finished successfully.
