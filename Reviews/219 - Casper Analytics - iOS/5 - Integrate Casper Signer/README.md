Reviewer was able to build and run the project by using the instructions given on the README of the project, after needed parameters entering to the .env file as per the instructions for the api project.
```
Laravel development server started: http://127.0.0.1:8000
[Thu Dec 30 20:17:33 2021] PHP 7.4.27 Development Server (http://127.0.0.1:8000) started
```

Reviewer got the following error when following the instructions in the readme file,but was able to run the project when reviewer changed the 'es2018' package to 'es2020' in the lib variable in the 'tsconfig.json' file for the webapp project.

While the 'cspr.live' redirect for the 'stake with us' button in the mobile app works fine but it gives a js error in the web app.

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The reviewer was unable to build and run the project following the instructions provided due to a target error in the lib file.
But apart from this error the documentation also provides adequate installation/execution instructions for different scenarios.
The reviewer thinks that the project functionality will meet the acceptance criteria once the bugs are fixed.


Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Project builds without errors | FAIL
Documentation provides sufficient installation/execution instructions | PASS
Project functionality meets/exceeds acceptance criteria and operates without error | FAIL

# Coding Standards

## General Observations

Code is generally well-structured and readable. The Github linked project is easy and successful to install, but an error was encountered during the installation phase of the app project. An error was received in the unit tests of the project. Manual tests fail for making a delegation using the casper signer. These errors prevent the project from succeeding.

# Final Conclusion
The project provides the most of the functionalities described in the grant application and milestone acceptance criteria. 
The reviewer praises the OP for the general stability and the fluid user experience of the app.
However, it is recommended to fix test errors in the lib file. Also the "delegate using casper signer" in the milestone doesn't work properly. 
Thus, in the reviewer's opinion, this submission should fail.
