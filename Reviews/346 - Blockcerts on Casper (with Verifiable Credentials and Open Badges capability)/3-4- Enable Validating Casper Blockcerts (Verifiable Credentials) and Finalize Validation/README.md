# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**



**Acceptance criteria:**

A user will be able to add a Casper Blockcerts-compatible validator to a website or web app. When a Casper Blockcert (Open Badges) is placed in this validator, it will display the credential using an attractive and sophisticated UI with several capabilities, chief of which is being able to process then validate said Blockcert against its batchâ€™s hash.

**Additional notes regarding submission from OP:**

Milestones #3 and #4 were both completed in this repo, so both submission reports will be identical. The target branch (and only branch) to evaluate is called "cspr". All the instructions necessary for evaluation should be in the "Casper-specific Instructions" section at the top of the README.
