# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

A Casper Blockcerts-compatible validator to a website or web app.

**Acceptance criteria:**

A user will be able to add a Casper Blockcerts-compatible validator to a website or web app. When a Casper Blockcert (Open Badges) is placed in this validator, it will display the credential using an attractive and sophisticated UI with several capabilities, chief of which is being able to process then validate said Blockcert against its batchâ€™s hash.

**Additional notes regarding submission from OP:**

Milestones #3 and #4 were both completed in this repo, so both submission reports will be identical. The target branch (and only branch) to evaluate is called "cspr". All the instructions necessary for evaluation should be in the "Casper-specific Instructions" section at the top of the README.

For verifying for Casper, the reviewer pushed "Casper Testnet" and "Casper Mainnet" buttons.

There are two options: verifying with URL or a JSON file.


The reviewer provided a JSON file both in Casper Testnet and Mainnet. After checking the cert, the program gave the result as these certs are "Verified".

The program also gives proper error messages when providing a unverified cert.
