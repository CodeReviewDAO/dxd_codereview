# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

- Source code in our own public Gitbhub repository;
- Unit-tests;
- Documentation

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Implements wrappers for key pairs under the curves ED25519 and SECP256K

**Additional notes regarding submission from OP:**

The implementation of the key pairs with the features such as reading pem files and signatures is available as an independent java project, under the repo:

https://github.com/syntifi/crypto-keys

and available on maven:
```xml
  <dependency>
        <groupId>com.syntifi.crypto</groupId>
        <artifactId>crypto-key-<SUBMODULE></artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
   </dependency>
```
  

The implementation of the put_deploy, the service to create transfers and the relevant serialization procedures are still under the repository of milestone 1:
https://github.com/syntifi/casper-sdk

Also available on maven:
```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.syntifi.casper</groupId>
    <artifactId>casper-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>

# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

Following the instructions in the readme files of the two repositories, the reviewer was able to:

1- build and run unit tests for the SDK:  [casper-sdk build and test](sdk-build-and-test.md)

2- build and run unit tests for the crypto module (key management) : [crypto-keys build and test](sdk-build-and-test.md)

The build and the tests were run on a MacOs Monterey 12.2.1 using the following tools:

- Java :
  ```bash
  java version "1.8.0_261"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_261-b12)
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.261-b12, mixed mode)
  ```
- Maven :
````bash
Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T17:41:47+01:00)
Java version: 1.8.0_261, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Default locale: fr_CH, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.16", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"

# Unit / Automated Testing

Casper-sdk contains a total of 89 unit tests covering both positive and negative paths
Crypto-keys module contains 15 unit tests. The reviewer checked the presence of some unit tests on negative paths in this module.

The reviewer has checked the presence of unit tests for the functionalities related to the creation of  deploys,signing them (using crypto module) and sending
them to the network using the put-deploy RPC call which was added to the SDK in this milestone.


All these tests run successfully :

-  [casper-sdk unit test](casper-sdk-unit-tests.md)
-  [cryptos-key unit test](crypto-keys-unit-tests.md)


Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Unit Tests - At least one positive path test | PASS
Unit Tests - At least one negative path test | PASS 
Unit Tests - Additional path tests | PASS

# Documentation

### Code Documentation

The reviewer has observed that the critical functions of the code-base has an acceptable level of code-level documentation by means of standard inline comments which allow auto-generation of the documentation.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Code Documented | PASS

### Project Documentation

The level of documentation on both projects is sufficient. The main page of the SDK project contains examples of using critical RPC functions.
The main page of the cryptos-keys module contains a 'how-to' detailing the main functionalities of 'key management' in the SDK.
The reviewer was able to import the maven libraries of the SDK and the crypto-key module, write and execute code snippets for both projects without too much difficulty.


Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Usage Documented | PASS 
Example Documented | PASS
