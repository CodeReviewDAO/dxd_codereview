# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

Repos were missing some instructions at the beginning and the reviewer sent a guide to OP to update the project's repos. OP updated this repo and informed the reviewer. Repos still had issues and the reviewer gave another feedback to OP before proceeding the final review.

By following the instructions in the README of the repository the reviewer was able to build and run the projects.

[front install](assets/frontnpminstall.md)

[front start](assets/frontnpmstart2.md)

[contracts build](assets/contractsmakebuild.md)

[back install](assets/backyarninstall.md)

[back run](assets/backrunbin.md)

[back node](assets/backnode.md)

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The project meets the acceptance criteria but there are few things to be fixed like decimal conversations and some ui dynamics. the documentation includes sufficient installation and execution instructions, and the project builds without issues. Below are some screenshots from front-end usage testing;
