**Additional notes regarding submission from OP:**

Regarding Milestone 6, we wanted to provide you with an update that Staking App is completed and is working as per the expectation. However, the URL (https://casper-staking.ferrumnetwork.io/) where the App is deployed needs to be whitelisted by Casper team, a request is already submitted. In the meantime, we have put together a step-by-step guide that will allow you to set up staking on your own end. The staking guide can be found here: https://github.com/ferrumnet/staking-casper-frontend Also, sharing the repos for staking for review: Casper staking frontend: https://github.com/ferrumnet/staking-casper-frontend/releases/tag/v0.5.0 Casper staking SmartContracts: https://github.com/ferrumnet/casper_staking/releases/tag/v0.3.1

# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

A Gitpod cloud environment running Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS was used for building and running the project across repositories.

The smart contract repository (`casper_staking`) was reviewed first. There was not any README at the root level of the repository, leaving the reviewer with no instructions for installing and running that part of the project. After checking the sub-directories, it was seen that there was a README under the `staking_contract` folder. Following the instructions in the `staking_contract` folder, the staking contracts were built successfully: [staking_contract_build.md](assets/staking_contract_build.md)

The staking smart contract was deployed successfully by following the instructions on the README.md file under the `staking_contract` directory:  [deploy.md](assets/deploy.md)

The frontend part was installed successfully following the instructions on the README.md file of the frontend repository. The frontend part was installed and runned successfully following the instructions on the README.md file of the frontend repository.

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The project builds without errors, the documentation provides sufficient installation and execution instructions, and the project functionality meets the acceptance criteria and operates without errors. Frontend build and run logs and Usage testing screenshots are given below;
