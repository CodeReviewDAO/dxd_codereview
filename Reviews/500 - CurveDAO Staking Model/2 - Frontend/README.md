# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

Deliverables
   - A UX Website + JS Clients for the front end
   - I wish we would just clone the old one but given our experience with Web3 and the CasperSwap UX, itâ€™s easier to just rebuild from scratch

**Acceptance criteria:**

We will add the UX to a testnet instance of CasperSwap as a fully integrated tab.

CRDAO: Verification will be a combination of a limited set of unit tests for the UX testing the primary user flows and manual testing instructions (probably through video, otherwise written) on how to operate the UX.

**Additional notes regarding submission from OP:**

Completed per requirements above
