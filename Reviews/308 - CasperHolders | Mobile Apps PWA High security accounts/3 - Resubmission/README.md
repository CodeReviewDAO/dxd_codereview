# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

Create a user friendly interface:
 - to add keys and modify the weight of them,
 - to modify the weight needed to perform action on the Casper network.

This will allow users to have backup spare keys in case of loss of their main key and add the ability to multi-sign deploys offline for exemple. (Offline deploys are not part of this milestone/grant. They are implemented but still not part of this grant.) All of this make users accounts safer for them & for the network.

**Acceptance criteria:**

Users will be able to:
 - add key to their account and modify the weight of it,
 - modify the weight needed to perform actions on the Casper Network.

This feature will be implemented only on the WEB/PWA version until ledger as a way to make complex deploys.

**Additional notes regarding submission from OP:**

Requirements of the last milestone is also complete.
