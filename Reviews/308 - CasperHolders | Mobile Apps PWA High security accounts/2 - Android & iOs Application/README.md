# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

The reviewer was able to install the project easily.

When following the step by step README , the reviewer faced some issues.  
Before building the app, it's important to have the simulator opened. It was mentionned in the part "Next Builds" but it should also be mentionned in the step "First Builds".  
Hoppefully the error message in the console is explicit :

![img.png](assets/casperholders_mobile_build_android_failed.png)

After starting the Emulator, the reviewer had a second error :

![img.png](assets/casperholders_mobile_build_android_failed_2.png)

Here again the message is explicit and the reviewer had to define the correct environment variable.en  
The OP advises the reviewer to define it like this :

```
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Now the app is running and working using the "yarn start" command.

The reviewer encountered same kind of messages while testing on a Mac (except the export of the environment variable)

The reviewer was able to use the app correctly :

The app was also tested on an iOS device with a Ledger Nano X without any issues.

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The reviewer faced some issues to correctly install and run the app.  
The OP corrected the isues when requested and the reviewer was able to run and test the app locally.

The reviewer recommands to the OP to add more details in the README to prevent questions about how to build and run the app.
  
Except that, the app meets the acceptance criteria.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Project builds without errors | PASS with Notes
Documentation provides sufficient installation/execution instructions | PASS with Notes
Project functionality meets/exceeds acceptance criteria and operates without error | PASS

# Unit / Automated Testing

While running the tests, the reviewer faced the same issues faced when building the app.

The first attempt with the tests gives the following error :

![img.png](assets/caspherholders_mobile_tests_failed.png)

After setting the environment variable :

```
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

It was running correctly :

The reviewer advises the OP to complete the README so the test will works correctly directly.  
The code covergare is overall very good and the reviewer praises the OPâ€™s efforts for that.
