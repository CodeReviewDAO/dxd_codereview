# Documentation

### Code Documentation

Some part of code is well documented via low level documentation. But the low level code documentation does not cover all the parts of the project([For example](https://github.com/odradev/odra/tree/0.1.0/lang/proc_macros/src)). Low level code documentation should cover all the parts of the project especially important classes. The reviewer observes that code documentation should be improved in the upcoming milestones.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Code Documented | PASS with notes

### Project Documentation


The project has a separate [documentation page](https://docs.rs/odra/latest/odra/). However, the purpose and usage details of the project should be more clearly stated in the readme and documentation. In addition, project codes are kept in 5 different repositories. This makes the documentation much more important in terms of intelligibility. The accepted project proposal states that the documentation will be written in the 3rd milestone. The reviewer observes that these situations should be taken into account when writing the documentation.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Usage Documented | PASS with notes
Example Documented | PASS with notes


## Overall Conclusion on Documentation
