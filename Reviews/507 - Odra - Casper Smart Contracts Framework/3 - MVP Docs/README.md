# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

Only "https://odra.dev/docs/" was submitted on the milestone submission but for building, installing, testing, and other standard review purposes [main repo](https://github.com/odradev/odra) of the project used aswell. 

Following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/odradev/odra) of the project and published docs, reviewer was able to successfully install the project along with it's dependencies, and run the tests for this milestone on Ubuntu 20.04. As mentioned on the review of the milestone 4 there are a lot of links to other repositories and sites on the readme, but it can be better to have more explanation about them in the README of the project instead of just linking to other repositories but published docs were better in this manner. Also, adding a requirement.txt and using it to install prerequisities might be useful too.

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The project builds without errors, the documentation provides sufficient installation and execution instructions. Build instructions are giving required information but can be enhanced and more clear by detailing each step. Same as installation instructions this part also needs improvements in the reviewer's opinion. The project functionality meets/exceeds the acceptance criteria and operates without errors.

## General Observations

The project published publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/odradev/odra). Project documentation is sufficient enough as general. Unit test coverage is good enough but can be improved, and all test run successfully.

Corresponding version of odra docs released on https://odra.dev/docs/.

# Final Conclusion

The project meets the milestone acceptance criteria.Install and usage instructions are sufficient but can be a bit confusing due to numerous links to other repositories and sites in the repo README. However, [the published docs](	https://odra.dev/docs) are comprehensive and well-organized. Screenshots from the docs can be found below. Tests run successfully.
