# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

The reviewer used a local installation of [Fedora Linux 35 (Workstation Edition)](assets/os-hardware.md) for the review. All instructions for the installation are available in the [README](https://github.com/odradev/odra) file. After following the instructions step by step, the reviewer was able to successfully install the project. However, it was observed that usage instructions and examples of creating and deploying ERC721 and ERC1155 smart contract to the Casper Network are not available in the documentation.

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The OP said that they have deployed erc721 to the network in their personal project but the reviewer observed that there was no instructions on how to create ERC721 and ERC1155 contract and deploy them to the Casper Network in documentation. Hence, the reviewer was unable to test ERC721 and ERC1155 on the Casper Network. The Op should provide users a clear documentation use ERC721 and ERC1155. Since
