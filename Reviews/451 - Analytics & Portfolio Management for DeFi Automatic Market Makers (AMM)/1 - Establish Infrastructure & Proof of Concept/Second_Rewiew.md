# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

Infrastructure design and setup
- Create GitHub repository
- Connect to Blockchain 
- Set up primary and backup nodes on mainnet for production use
- Connect to Testnet
- Define FLUIDEFI DB schema for AMM (Example: CasperSwap)
- Test current DEVxDAO Python & Javascript SDKs to ensure there is functionality in place to build the entire FLUIDEFI proposed project. A large amount of effort will be put into this step. Specifically, FLUIDEFIâ€™s current production platform is built entirely with Web3. For this step we will need to code test scripts to ensure Python & Javascript SDKs have the necessary functionality and are working without errors. If problems with the SDKs are found, our team will work with the SDK developers to resolve those issues. During this time, this project may be put on hold.

**Acceptance criteria:**

LINK: GitHub repository
NODES: Set up primary and backup nodes on mainnet for production use Connect to Testnet

# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

Following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools) and [docs](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/blob/main/docs/INSTALLATION.md) of the project, the reviewer was able to install the project as a package successfully and created the Postgres DB.

## Overall Impression of usage testing

Initially, the reviewer encountered some difficulties while building the project and contacted the OP, and OP made the necessary changes immediately. The [documentation](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/tree/main/docs) provides sufficient installation and execution instructions along with the usage examples. Reviewer encountered difficulties applying usage examples and got some errors, but OP fixed those issues fast, and now usage examples execute without any error. Project functionality meets the acceptance criteria and operates without errors.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Project builds without errors | PASS
Documentation provides sufficient installation/execution instructions | PASS
Project functionality meets/exceeds acceptance criteria and operates without error | PASS

# Unit / Automated Testing

The project has unit tests for all critical classes and methods. [CI Actions](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/runs/8023466793?check_suite_focus=true) was active on the GitHub repository. The reviewer checked the tests in CI Actions, and they were executed on without errors. Initially, testing instructions were missing in the documentation, but after reporting them to OP, project documentation got updated, and OP added test instructions. Reviewer ran tests manually by following the instructions on the README of the project, and they completed successfully too.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Unit Tests - At least one positive path test | PASS
Unit Tests - At least one negative path test | PASS
Unit Tests - Additional path tests | PASS

# Documentation

### Code Documentation

Code was missing inline comments and low-level code documentation, but the reviewer contacted OP regarding this issue, and OP fixed it immediately. Now Code is generally well documented, and critical classes have comments. Low-level code documentation is good enough to meet CRDAO code review standards and allow auto-generation of the documentation. Also, after the reviewer's suggestion, OP added auto-generated typedocs files under the [docs](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/tree/main/docs/typedocs) folder of the project.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Code Documented | PASS

### Project Documentation

Initially, the project documentation was in lousy shape and missing some instructions, but after the reviewer's comments and suggestions, OP updated it. The README file provides the necessary information to overview the project quickly. The README has instructions and links to the documentation regarding [INSTALLATION](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/blob/main/docs/INSTALLATION.md) and [USAGE OWERWIEW](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/blob/main/docs/USAGE_OVERVIEW.md). Usage examples needed minor changes and OP immediately updated them after reviewer's suggestion. Now, documentation has sufficient usage examples and instructions that execute without errors. OP managed to try and run all examples without any issues by following instructions.

## Overall Conclusion on Documentation

In the reviewer's opinion, documentation for the project is sufficient for this milestone.

# Open Source Practices

# Coding Standards

## General Observations

The project meets the acceptance criteria. Code repo is available, test scripts have been written and included in the repository, and CI Actions are active in the repository. Source code is well written and has a sufficient amount of code-level documentation. OP is reachable and responsive in general.

Design diagrams and schemas, which are also mentioned in milestone submission by OP, are included in the repository as pdf files and can be found under [schema folder](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/tree/main/src/schema).

Infrastructure Diagram
![](assets/infra.png)

[Mainnet](caspernet02.fluidefi.io:8888/status) and [Testnet](caspertest1.fluidefi.io:8888/status) nodes are active and located at locations below, but OP reported that RPC ports are not public because of security reasons:
Mainnet: caspernet02.fluidefi.io
Testnet: caspertest1.fluidefi.io

OP planned to use public nodes as backup nodes, which is fine in the reviewer's opinion as it conforms to best practices.

[Docs](https://analytics.fluidefi.com/api/docs/#overview) of API Definition for RESTful API calls available online.

OP was reachable and had good communication. OP generally fixed issues reported by the reviewer immediately.

# Final Conclusion

The reviewer recommends that this submission should PASS as it meets the milestone acceptance criteria and DEVxDAO standards.
