# Milestone Details

## Details & Acceptance Criteria

**Details of what will be delivered in milestone:**

Infrastructure design and setup
- Create GitHub repository
- Connect to Blockchain 
- Set up primary and backup nodes on mainnet for production use
- Connect to Testnet
- Define FLUIDEFI DB schema for AMM (Example: CasperSwap)
- Test current DEVxDAO Python & Javascript SDKs to ensure there is functionality in place to build the entire FLUIDEFI proposed project. A large amount of effort will be put into this step. Specifically, FLUIDEFIâ€™s current production platform is built entirely with Web3. For this step we will need to code test scripts to ensure Python & Javascript SDKs have the necessary functionality and are working without errors. If problems with the SDKs are found, our team will work with the SDK developers to resolve those issues. During this time, this project may be put on hold.

**Acceptance criteria:**

CODE: Test scripts and results

LINK: GitHub repository
NODES: Set up primary and backup nodes on mainnet for production use Connect to Testnet

## Milestone Submission

The following milestone assets/artifacts were submitted for review:

Repository | Revision Reviewed
------------ | -------------
https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools | 3b0f164


# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

Following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools) of the project, the reviewer was able to successfully install the project as a package.

![](assets/install.png)

## Overall Impression of usage testing

The project was installed without errors, the documentation provides sufficient installation and execution instructions along with the usage examples. Current usage instructions are sufficient enough for this phase of the project but it should be improved by adding how tos and collecting usage examples on a seperate file can be better, reviewer encountered some difficulties while applying usage examples and informed OP about them too. Project functionality meets the acceptance criteria and operates without errors.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Project builds without errors | PASS
Documentation provides sufficient installation/execution instructions | PASS With Notes
Project functionality meets/exceeds acceptance criteria and operates without error | PASS

# Unit / Automated Testing

The project has unit tests for all critical classes and methods. [CI Actions](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/runs/8023466793?check_suite_focus=true) are enabled on github repository. Reviewer checked the tests in CI Actions and they were successfully completed without any errors. Also, reviewer ran tests manually and they completed successfully too but testing instructions should be added to README of the project.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Unit Tests - At least one positive path test | PASS
Unit Tests - At least one negative path test | PASS
Unit Tests - Additional path tests | PASS

# Documentation

### Code Documentation

Code was missing inline comments and low-level code documentation but reviewer contacted to OP regarding this issue and OP fixed it immediately. Now Code is generally well documented and critical classes have comments. Low-level code documentation is good enough to meet CRDAO code review standarts and allow auto-generation of the documentation.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Code Documented | PASS

### Project Documentation

The README file provides the necessary information to install the project but its missing testing instructions, OP already has been informed by reviewer and issue will be fixed. Usage examples are documented in README but in reviewers opinion these should be in seperate file like USAGE.MD or HOW_TOS.md in a seperate docs folder, expected outputs can be added too. Also, auto generated typedoc file can be added to repository aswell. Rewiewer encountered some errors and difficulties while trying usage examples and informed OP and they will be fixed. OP has been informed by reviewer regarding these things and all will be fixed.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
Usage Documented | PASS with Notes
Example Documented | PASS with Notes

## Overall Conclusion on Documentation

In reviewer's opinion documentation for the project is sufficient for this milestone but it should be improved along with reviewer's suggestions.

# Open Source Practices

## Licenses

The Project is released under the MIT License.

Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
OSI-approved open source software license | PASS

## Contribution Policies

The project contains a CONTRIBUTING and SECURITY policy that links to a Code of Conduct. Pull requests and Issues are enabled.
Requirement | Finding
------------ | -------------
OSS contribution best practices | PASS

# Coding Standards

## General Observations

Project meets the acceptance criteria. Code repo is available, test scripts are written and CI actions has been used. 

Design diagrams and schemas, which are also mentioned in milestone submission, are included in repository as pdf files and can be found under [schema folder](https://github.com/fluidefi/fluidefi-caspernet-aggregator-tools/tree/main/src/schema)

Infrastructure Diagram
![](assets/infra.png)

[Mainnet](caspernet02.fluidefi.io:8888/status) and [Testnet](caspertest1.fluidefi.io:8888/status) nodes are active and located at:
Mainnet: caspernet02.fluidefi.io
Testnet: caspertest1.fluidefi.io

Public nodes planned to be used as backup nodes and which is fine in reviewer's opinion as it conforms to best practices.

[Docs](https://analytics.fluidefi.com/api/docs/#overview) of API Definition for RESTful API calls available online.

![](assets/onlinedocs.png)

OP was reachable and has good communication. Issues reported by reviewer generally fixed immediately.

Project has usage examples for each class in README but as mentioned in documantation review notes these should be reshaped in a seperate file and folder, also usage instructions and examples should be improved and extended.

# Final Conclusion

Reviewer recommends that this submission should PASS with Notes as it has some minor issues to be fixed but meets the acceptance criteria functionality.

# Recommendation

Recommendation | PASS with Notes
