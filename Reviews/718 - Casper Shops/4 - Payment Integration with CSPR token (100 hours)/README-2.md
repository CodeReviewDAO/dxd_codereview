# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

The reviewer used Fedora Linux 35 for review of this project and followed instructions given on README. After reviewing the project, the reviewer observed that documentation needed some improvements, ```About``` section in github repository was empty, Deploy example on README file didn't work and negative test cases were not available. There were 5 integration tests. The reviewer's first attemp to build the project by following the instructions given on the README resulted in [failure](assets/fail-to-build-logs.md). However, it was successfully built after the reviewer has done some research on this issue. It was solved by running ```rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown``` then ```make build-contract``` commands in succession. The reviewer contacted to the OP to discuss on the issues mentioned above. OP immediately started to work on these issues. OP improved the project documentation, updated deploy command given on README, added description on github ```About``` section and also added more test cases both positive and negative test cases. 



## Overall Impression of usage testing

- [Build logs](assets/backend-build.md)

Example of sending WASM file to casper node and deploy it on the chain.

```bash
ndpc_contract (main)$ casper-client put-deploy -n http://89.58.52.245:7777 \

Deploy the contract: https://testnet.cspr.live/deploy/397b1cb7941f75e34a898e89caceac3fc6f51b4b1b9d7e353fc9ec948c44416e

## Usage Testing

## 1. Process of Testing a Contract
Three accounts are needed to test the contract, Account names can be `producer`, `publisher` and `customer` respectively.
These accounts should be created on `Casper Wallet` and faucet them on TestNet.

Unlock the casper wallet

![](assets/images/1-login-wallet.png)

Select the `settings` section and then click on the `Create Account` button there

![](assets/images/2-add-account.png)

Give a name to your account and click on the `Create Account`

![](assets/images/3-add-producer-account.png)

You should do this for all the 3 mentioned accounts. Then you'll need to faucet your accounts on testnet, Select your account on your wallet and hit `Manage Account`

Click `View on CSPR.live`

![](assets/images/5-wallet.png)

When you are on casper testnet, click on the `Connect` button on your account

![](assets/images/6-wallet-and-csprlive.png)

Click the `faucet` button

![](assets/images/7-faucet.png)

Fill in the captcha, and Click on the `Request tokens` button, It would take up to 2 minutes to give you 2000 CSPRs. Do as so for other 2 accounts, So at the end you would have 3 accounts with 2000 CSPRs in each of them.
