# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

The reviewer used Fedora Linux 35 for review of this project and followed instructions given on README. After reviewing the project, the reviewer observed that documentation needed some improvements, ```About``` section in github repository was empty, Deploy example on README file didn't work and negative test cases were not available. There were 5 integration tests. The reviewer's first attemp to build the project by following the instructions given on the README resulted in [failure](assets/fail-to-build-logs.md). However, it was successfully built after the reviewer has done some research on this issue. It was solved by running ```rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown``` then ```make build-contract``` commands in succession. The reviewer contacted to the OP to discuss on the issues mentioned above. OP immediately started to work on these issues. OP improved the project documentation, updated deploy command given on README, added description on github ```About``` section and also added more test cases both positive and negative test cases. 



## Overall Impression of usage testing
