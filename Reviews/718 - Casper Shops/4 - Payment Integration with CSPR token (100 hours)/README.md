# Final Conclusion

In the reviewer's opinion, this submission should fail directly due to matching one or more of the criteria listed on [possible causes of a direct failure by the CRDAO](https://github.com/CodeReviewDAO/dxd_codereview/blob/main/DIRECT-FAILURE-CAUSES.md), including but not limited to:

- **License missing**
- **README file is practically empty**, missing crucial parts such as the instructions for installing and running the code, running the tests, and the user/project documentation. It is, in fact, the placeholder README of the React framework.
- No contribution guidelines or security policy
- No CI action or static code analysis
- Dependabot alerts are not enabled or not attended to. (There are high and moderate severity security alerts when enabled.)
- There are no functional tests on the repo. When the reviewer tried the common commands to run the tests, the attempt resulted in error.

The recommendation being a DIRECT FAILURE, a full review was not done, and the review was priced accordingly, as per the DxD and the CRDAO's joint policy.
