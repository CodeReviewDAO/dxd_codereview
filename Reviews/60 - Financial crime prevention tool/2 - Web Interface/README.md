# Install & Usage Testing Procedure and Findings

Following the instructions in the README file of the repositoty : https://github.com/syntifi/ori and the file provided as a guide for this milestone
https://github.com/syntifi/ori/blob/main/TLDR-CSPR.md


First of all , Reviewer started with installing the required dependencies.

```console
Java 11
Maven (3.8.1 or above)
Docker
Docker compose (version 1.29.2 or above)
Node.js (>=14.0.0)
```

**Test and build the project:**

```bash
kutaykarademir@MacBook-Pro ori-main % ./mvnw clean compile

```
Output:

![img.jpeg](Assets/cleanCompile.jpeg)

**Build libs, jars and images:**

```bash
kutaykarademir@MacBook-Pro ori-main % ./mvnw package -DskipTests
```
Output:

![img.jpeg](Assets/DskipTest.jpeg)

**Create a docker network ori and try to start postgresql and api:**

```bash
kutaykarademir@MacBook-Pro ori-main %  docker network create ori  //Create a docker network ori
kutaykarademir@MacBook-Pro ori-main % docker-compose -f ./ori-api/src/main/docker/docker-compose-jvm.yml up -d  //Start postgresql and api modules (docker images)
kutaykarademir@MacBook-Pro ori-main % docker-compose -f ori-api/src/main/docker/docker-compose-jvm.yml ps. //Check if both went up
```
Reviewer failed to run the ori-api on the first try, but after the second try the ori-api was up and running. (OP has specified in the read.me file that this problem may occur and how to solve it.)

Output:

![img.jpeg](Assets/apiUp.jpeg)

**Launch the crawler for CSPR chain:**

```bash
kutaykarademir@MacBook-Pro ori-main % docker-compose -f ./ori-chains/ori-cspr/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
kutaykarademir@MacBook-Pro ori-main %  docker-compose -f ori-chains/ori-cspr/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml ps
```
Output:

 ![img.jpeg](Assets/chainUp.jpeg)
 
The reviewer was then able to check crawler is up and running using the following command line :

 ```bash
docker-compose -f ori-chains/ori-cspr/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f
 ```
 Output:
 
 ![img.jpeg](Assets/logs.jpeg)

**Check the database:**

```bash
docker exec -i docker_ori-postgresql_1 psql -U ori_db_user ori_db < ori-chains/ori-cspr/src/test/resources/db-sample/ori_db_sample.sql
```
The reviewer uploaded a sample of crawler data for testing purposes and observed the data using postgresql for control purpose.

   ![block](Assets/blockData.png)
   
   ![transaction](Assets/transactionData.png)
   
   ![token](Assets/tokenData.png)

**Web Interface(Frontend & Api):**

The reviewer was able to reach the web interface from http://localhost:8080 after completing all the steps and could easily observe the data from the interface by using a user account from the sample data.
