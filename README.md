# DEVxDAO Code Review

This repository contains the records for the code reviews performed on 
behalf of the Code Review DAO (CRDAO) for the DEVxDAO.

Until a version of [Proposal #185](https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/185) is adopted by the DEVxDAO, the Code Review process
adhered to will try to satisfy the requirements upvoted by the 
DEVxDAO Voting Associates outlines in [Proposal #191](https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/191). Similarly, the Definition of
Done provided in [Proposal #196](https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/196) is used as a guideline but not a 
pass/fail requirement until approved by vote of the DEVxDAO Voting Associates.

These approved-by-vote requirements are:

The DxD resolves that the primary output of a code review should affirm the following objectives:

Documentation:
- Low level function documentation
  
(Unit) Testing 
- Does the software do what is advertised in the milestone
- Critical path test coverage
    - At least one positive path test
    - At least one negative path test
    - Additional path tests are preferred (But not required)
- API endpoints require tests (if applicable)
- Coding standards
    - Reasonable compliance with then evolving coding standards under the layer 1 solution chosen in the given grants
- License compliance checks: E.G.: Plagiarism/Attribution, Copyright violation etc with regard to the MIT license.

Meanwhile, some of the proposed requirements in Proposal 185 will also be 
tested and reported on informationally only.
